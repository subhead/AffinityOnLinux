# How to Set Up Wine for Affinity on Lutris

## 1. Install ElementalWarrior Wine Version

- [ElementalWarrior](https://github.com/Twig6943/ElementalWarrior-wine-binaries/releases) (Recommended) (Just right click and extract)

- [Wine-tkg-affinity](https://github.com/daegalus/wine-tkg-affinity/releases) also works with Lutris but if you're going to use that you gotta edit the .yaml yourself.

## 2. Install Lutris (Flatpak recommended)

Install Lutris using either **Flatpak** or **AppImage**.

- Flatpak: https://flathub.org/apps/net.lutris.Lutris
- AppImage: https://github.com/lucasmz1/Lutris_AppImage

## 3. Copy & paste Wine Binaries

Copy & paste the wine binaries you've extracted earlier to Lutrisâ€™ runners directory:

- **Flatpak:** `~/.var/app/net.lutris.Lutris/data/lutris/runners/wine/`
- **AppImage:** `~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/`

## Rename the `ElementalWarriorWine` folder to `ElementalWarriorWine-x86_64`

It should look like this at the end
